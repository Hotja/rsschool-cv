            <h3>Summary:</h3>
            If we are talking about training, then I want to understand the principles of building sites, to master the programming language HTML and JavaScript. Develop new knowledge and the ability to apply them in practice. Also improve my english and find new friends.
    Skills: Finished university. I have been working for system administrators for more than 10 years. I have knowledge of building LANs of different difficulty levels. Installation and configuration of server operating systems of the Windows and Linux (Debian) family. General understanding of the work and setup of hypervisors. Extensive experience in operating 1 line of technical support for users. I fix any problems because I am "тыжпрограммист". :)
